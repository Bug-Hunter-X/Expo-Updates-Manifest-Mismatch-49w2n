This error occurs when using the `expo-updates` package in combination with a custom build process. The issue stems from a mismatch between the update manifest generated by Expo and the actual code being deployed. This might happen if you modify the build process without updating the manifest accordingly or if there is a discrepancy between the development and production builds.
