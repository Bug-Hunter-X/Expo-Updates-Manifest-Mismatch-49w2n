# Expo Updates Manifest Mismatch

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the Expo updates system. The problem arises when there is a mismatch between the update manifest generated by Expo and the actual code deployed. This usually occurs when modifying the build process, creating inconsistencies between development and production environments.

## Bug Description

The primary symptom of this bug is unexpected application crashes or incorrect behavior in the production environment. This happens because the app is trying to load a version of the code that doesn't match the manifest's information. The exact manifestation of the error can vary depending on the specifics of the mismatch. 

## Reproduction

The following steps reproduce this bug: 

1.  Create a new Expo project.
2. Implement custom build steps that modify the final build artifacts. 
3. Deploy the app using the custom build process. 
4. Try to update the app through Expo's update mechanism. 

## Solution

The solution involves carefully coordinating the custom build process with the update manifest. Make sure any changes made during the build process are reflected in the manifest as well. This frequently involves either generating a new manifest or properly updating an existing one during the build process.   One potential strategy is to generate the manifest after completing the build steps so that it accurately reflects the final application's state.
